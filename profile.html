                    <h3>Brief History of Earth Day

                        </h3>
                    <p>Celebrating Earth Day!
                        Thanks for celebrating Earth Day with LongView! 
                        
        
                        “There can be no greater issue than that of Conservation in this country.”
                        — Theodore Roosevelt
                        People often ask “When is Earth Day?”
                         Earth Day is celebrated annually on April 22nd and marks a pivotal moment in the 
                         modern environmental movement. The day originated in 1970, inspired by the 1969 Santa 
                         Barbara oil spill when former Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson called for a nationwide 
                         environmental teach-in. The first Earth Day brought 20 million Americans together from 
                         all walks of life to encourage a sustainable environment. They set the scene for what 
                         would later be a major mobilization and environmental awareness of public opinion in
                          the country toward environmental issues. Today, you may ask “What countries celebrate 
                          Earth Day?”. Earth Day has become one of the major events on the planet, celebrated as
                           a "global event" by one billion people from hundreds of countries.</p>

                    <h3>Shimla – Inside Bollywood’s Favourite Background</h3>
                    <p>Shimla – Inside Bollywood’s Favourite Background
                        Posted by untravel | | Himachal Pradesh, India, Nature, Relax
                        Shimla Toy Train</p>
                    <p>  Shimla offers much more than charming colonial buildings against a backdrop of the magnificent
                         snow-capped Himalayas. Much more than the dozens of Bollywood songs set on Mall Road or its
                          oldest boarding schools. The upper reaches around the Shimla region offer skating on natural
                           ice as well as host the MTB Himalaya (South East Asia’s biggest mountain biking race). 
                           Shimla also boasts ownership of the 16th century “Arya Astha Sahasrikas Prajna Paramita” Tibetan
                            script (at the quaint Maria Brothers antique booksellers) and the Jakhu Temple Shrine with Lord
                             Hanuman’s footprints.</p>
                        
                     <p>  Originally part of the Kingdom of Nepal (before it was declared the British Summer Capital of India), 
                        pleasant summers and snow-covered winters make Shimla a favorite weekend getaway with tourists all
                         year-round. Expect a tattoo artist around every corner, but expect no food after midnight. Legendary 
                         ghost stories (Chudail Baudi, for single men whose cars slow down for the lady in the white sari) and 
                         fantastic cultural heritage make this visit all the more memorable. un[travel] your way up that UNESCO
                          heritage railway route to Shimla for sights and sounds like never before.<p>
                        
                      <p> Places to visit in Shimla</p>
                         
                        
                       <label> 1. Heritage Walk through Shimla</label>
                        
                        
                      <p>Shimla has a lot of stories to tell, some legends, and more heritage, but all equally exciting.
                         Begins at the appropriately named ‘Scandal Point’ where legend has it that the Maharajah of Patiala
                          was exiled from Shimla after a fierce argument with the Viceroy (some stories say he eloped with the
                           Viceroy’s daughter) and was eventually exiled from Shimla –giving this spot its name in 1892. Send
                            yourself a postcard from the timber-structured ‘wild west Swiss’-styled 133-year-old Shimla General 
                            Post Office as a souvenir.</p>
                        
                     <p>   Pass Christ Church on the ridge that was built back in 1857 with its tower clock and fresco designed by 
                        Rudyard Kipling’s father. Take a break at The Town Hall’s steps, but make way for officials as it’s still 
                        used by the Municipal Corporation of Shimla. Get transported to the grandeur and aura of times gone by at 
                        the century-old Gaiety Theatre before you move on to the ancient Kali Bari Temple. Stop for a breather at
                         the neo-Gothic Gorton Castle set in the midst of gigantic Deodars. Walk past the enormous Vidhan Sabha to 
                         the old Victorian mansion that now houses the Himachal State Museum with its numerous cultural treasures. 
                         Be prepared for a pleasant colonial hangover at the end of this walk.</p>
                        
                    <label>   2. Kufri and Chail</label>
                        
                        
                       <p> Lush green hills mark summer in Kufri– a stark contrast to the fantastic snow slopes that make tobogganing 
                        ‘the’ thing to do at the end of the year. If you’re visiting in January, try your hand at the ‘National Snow 
                        Statue Competition’ here in Kufri. A short walk around would take you past colonial-Esque statues at Chini
                         Bungalow to the Himalayan nature park.</p>
                        
                      <p>  Head on to Koti for a picnic in unexplored gardens surrounded by orchards. Tall pine and deodar forests 
                        signal the entry to Chail at about 2250 meters above MSL. Renowned for the worlds’ highest cricket pitch and 
                        polo grounds (at 2444 m above MSL), Chail is also home to the majestic summer palace of the Maharaja of Patiala 
                        built in 1891 (when exiled from Shimla by the British). Walk back in time through fascinating Indo-English architecture 
                        set on sprawling lawns with wide patios and corridors that echo with voices of an era gone by.</p>
                        
                         
                        
                       <label> 3. Kipling’s home and Viceregal Lodge</label>
                        
                        
                      <p>  What makes Shimla more alluring is its glorious past, the days when it was the summer capital during the British 
                        Raj. Beneath the Kali Bari temple, at the North Bank, lays an ordinary house where there once lived an extraordinary 
                        writer, Rudyard Kipling. This Nobel laureate spent most of his summer vacations here where memories of Jungle Book 
                        still linger on. Move on to the Viceregal Lodge. This was originally built as a home and summer residence of subsequent 
                        viceroys and governors-general of India. Leave history behind, for a peaceful walk through dense forests for a quiet
                         moment of solitude with a quaint picnic basket for the company.</p>
                        
                      <label> 4. Jakhu Temple Hike</label>
                        
                        
                       <p>Heritage and reverence have co-existed in the hill-town of Shimla for a long time now. Hike up from the east end
                         of the ridge of Shimla, towards the revered Jakhu temple. Through the gates of the Rothney Castle; once the home of
                          the great naturalist, A.O. Hume, hikes uphill to a beautiful temple complemented by the hymns filling the air and 
                          the wall murals depicting Hindu myths! A looming 33m tall Hanuman statue and a battalion of His minions stay with 
                          you as you stroll through the surrounding forests.</p>
                        
                       <label> 5. Toy Train Ride</label>
                        
                        
                       <p> 103 tunnels, 864 bridges, 919 curves, and a ride of a lifetime: Welcome aboard the Shimla-Kalka ‘toy train’.
                         This UNESCO heritage train chugs slowly up the mountains, seemingly playing an interesting game of hiding and seek 
                         with tunnels. Gradual ascents on winding tracks, flanked by age-old trees on either side, seem straight out of a
                          storybook. Over a century old, the ‘toy train’ still chugs into the hearts of the hundreds who travel in it every
                           day. Made more memorable with numerous Bollywood songs, there’s nothing like a ride up to Shimla with the tune of 
                           ‘gaadi bula rahi hai, seeti baja rahi hai’ probably playing on in your head.</p>
                        
                       <label>Best time to Visit Shimla</label>
                       <p> March to June is the popular tourist season when the weather is perfect for outdoor activities and quite 
                        pleasant. If you’re the type to lace up your adventure boots, this is the time to visit here with paragliding,
                         trekking, camping, and rafting all up for grabs.</p>
                       <p>July to September sees heavy rainfall and quite a drop-in visitors. On the upside, the rains make the hills
                         more luxuriant and if you’re the kind who prefers dripping weather and lonesome hikes, this time has your name all over it.</p>
                       <p> October to February is the typical Shimla filming weather with huge dollops of snow thrown in! Also, a popular time for visitors.
                        Although a year-round destination, the activities open to you may vary based on when you visit. So, plan accordingly.</p>
                        
                      <label>  Things to carry</label>
                       <p> Pack as light as possible given the amount of road travel involved here.</p>
                       <label>• Cotton clothing for summer and a light jacket would work for when evenings get cooler. If you’re un[travel]ling 
                        in winter, warmer clothes complete with thick socks and warmer jackets. Carry your windcheater and umbrella if you’re 
                        here in the monsoons as well.</label><br>
                       <label>• Sturdy walking shoes, mandatory if you’re hiking, make sense given the amount of walking involved here.</label><br>
                       <label>• Sunscreen, especially if you’re going up to the higher reaches. Usual prescription medications.</label></p><br>
